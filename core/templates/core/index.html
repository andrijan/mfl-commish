  <p>Congratulations to <strong>Kristján</strong> for his 2nd Championship title! It seems to be money or nothing for the Cobras. After winning the title in our first year, 2016, they finished last in 2017, then snatching the 3rd place last year and winning it all again this year.</p>

  <h2>Switching platforms</h2>
  <p>
    I've decided that I will move the league to the Sleeper platform (<a href="https://sleeper.app">sleeper.app</a>) for the following reasons:
    <ul class="ui list">
      <li>Active mobile app</li>
      <li>Way better UX</li>
      <li>Waiver system</li>
      <li>Free</li>
      <li>Any many more reasons</li>
    </ul>
    We will lose some fun stats, but I will just track them manually and share them with you.
  </p>
  <h2>League changes</h2>
  <div>
    <p>For the next season, there will be a couple of changes:</p>
    <h3>Weekly payouts</h3>
    <p>
      There was some heated discussion in our chat regarding motives to setting line-ups for losing teams. To keep the game fun and engaging for every team, we are implementing weekly payouts. There will be 2 types of payouts.
      <ul class="ui list">
        <li>The team with the most points</li>
        <li>The team with the highest efficiency</li>
      </ul>
      Since we are moving away from MyFantasyLeague, we will save around 10,000 ISK each year and that money will go into the weekly payouts, 5,000 for each pot (divided by 16 weeks)
    </p>
    <h3>6th seed</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The 6th seed will, from now on, be handed to the team with most teams scored of the lowest 7 records. I've been thinking about this a lot for while now and after researching and discussing it with fellow commissioners, I've reached an conclusion that this is in the best interest of the league. @ScottFish24 on Twitter is the most respected commissioner in the industry and hosts hundreds of leagues each year and this tweet below from him confirmed my reasoning.</p>

      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Been preaching this for WELL OVER A DECADE NOW!
